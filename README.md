# weeks-to-date
Little tool to get the number 
of weeks that are between [today] 
and the day you are interested in.
Made this to calculate how many letters (meant to
send one every Friday) I was going to write to my
girlfriend from the day I finished uni until she 
finished school (they turned out to be 72).
Feel free to use and improve my
little tool.
